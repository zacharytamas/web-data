It’s been a while since I wrote in here but for good reason. In the past two months or so I have:

- Agreed to join the engineering team at Opendoor here in their Atlanta office.
- My wife and I have welcomed the birth of our twin boys
- Shopped for and purchased our first home

There’s a lot in the works and 2019 has been a busy year already. I’m looking forward to things settling down in the next few months, however.

I always welcome talking with people on the Internet who are interested in the same things as me. The easiest way to contact me is via email: [me@zacharytamas.com](mailto:me@zacharytamas.com). I check my email as little as possible though, usually once in the morning, so please be patient. ðŸ˜Š

I am also on Twitter as [@zacharytamas](https://twitter.com/zacharytamas) though I am not always the most responsive on there. I go periods of weeks sometimes where I don't visit Twitter, but I do eventually respond to them all.
